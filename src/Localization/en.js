        "1921 - Turkvodkhoz, later Sredazvodkhoz. Z.F. Gorizdro-Kulchitskaya (1925), N.F. Bezobrazova (1927) worked on the restoration of irrigation systems in the Department of Hydrogeology, gave an overview description of the hydrogeological conditions of the basins of the Chirchik, Angren, Keles rivers. To study bass. R. Zarafshan invited Leningrad specialists A.N. Nikolaev, S.A. Butov, S.F. Mashkovtsev (1925). Since 1924, a group of hydrogeologists headed by O.K. Lange has been constantly working. The research results are published in issues of the Journal of Irrigation and in the works of SAGU (Muzhchinkin, 1924-1928; Reshetkin, 1927-1929; Arkhangelsky, 1928; Tolstikhin, 1924-1928).",

Tulyaganov. ) and industry demanded new ideas from hydrogeologists and geologists in the development of science and production. The Uzbekhydrogeology trust (Kh.T. Tulyaganov and others), the GIDROINGEO Institute (G.A. Mavlyanov) were organized. economy in the field of hydrogeology and engineering geology.",

        "- conducts research work to study the patterns of formation of groundwater; identification of resources and industrial brines for their use in the national economy; development of the main issues of reclamation hydrogeology of irrigated agriculture areas; studying the patterns of distribution of loess rocks and their engineering and geological properties; improvement of methods and techniques of hydrogeological works; analysis of their economy and efficiency; scientific substantiation of hydrogeological and engineering-geological studies; development of individual practical proposals for the prompt solution of issues of the national economy by production organizations; coordination of research and thematic work on hydrogeology and engineering geology of the arid zone. In the above areas, the institute has done work, reflected in published works, symposiums, meetings and seminars, recommendations submitted to industrial organizations. However, in general, it lags behind in solving problems related to with the acceleration of scientific and technological progress in hydrogeological and engineering geological research. In particular, scientific work on geophysical methods, aerial methods, methods of hydrogeological and engineering geological mapping and prospecting and exploration work and the development of theoretical foundations have not yet received due development. In these areas contains large reserves for increasing the geological and economic efficiency of hydrogeological and engineering geological research. due to connecting links in major problems of science and practice. Insufficient technical equipment. The Institute does not have a laboratory facility that meets the requirements of modern times. In addition to technical equipment, it is necessary to attract additional personnel of specialists (scientists), as well as a powerful production and experimental base, without which development of our society, further scientific and technological progress cannot be expected",
