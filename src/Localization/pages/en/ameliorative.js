  paragraph5: `The physical properties of soils are determined by the granulometric and mineralogical composition of soils. Нeavy loamy rocks are generally characterized by нigher values, silty loams by lower and average values, 
  The natural moisture content of soils varies over a wide range, increasing with the of silt and clay particles content;
  The filtration properties of rocks are characterized by extreme spatial heterogeneity both from one geomorphological zone to another, and within one zone;

    "Construction of hydrogeological models of horizontal water intakes (galleries) in order to reassess groundwater reserves ",
  models1: "Laying a perforated pipe at the bottom of a trench at the Damkhodzha site ",
  models2: "Footage from a video filmed inside the intake gallery",
  paragraph7: `Searching and finding sites suitable for the construction and operation of gallery-type water intakes is a complex task and requires close attention and intellectual expenditure of hydrogeologists. 
  The construction of such structures without hydrogeological justification is unacceptable and will lead to unpredictable material and financial losses without obtaining the desired effect. 
  At the same time, gallery water intakes are more economical than borehole ones, since they are designed to extract groundwater from a depth of up to 10 m without using electricity..
