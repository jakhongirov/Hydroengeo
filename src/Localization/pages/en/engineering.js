  secondaryHeading3: "Application and development of modern methods ",
  paragraph17: `-Currently, modeling of hydrogeological and engineering-geological conditions, geophysical methods are used and mastered to analyze and evaluate changes in the hydrogeological and engineering-geological conditions of ore deposits in open or underground mining methods.
     For objects in Uzbekistan, in particular, modeling was used for the Gussay and Guzhumsay fields. --In GIS technology a digital map will be compiled for predicting changes in the engineering-geological and hydrogeological conditions of deposits during underground mining. The map is compiled according to the types of zoning, where areas are identified according to the intensity and assessment of engineering and geological conditions during the development of deposits: unchanged, slightly changing and strongly changing. 
     -When allocating sites, engineering and geological features were taken into account as well as the interpretation of geophysical studies (materials) and modeling.
     -Much attention is paid to the study and evaluation of the stability of mine workings. This makes it possible to evaluate changes in the stress-strain state of rock masses with the wide use of geophysical methods; geological and structural conditions of deposits; modeling of geological objects and other processes; as well as the study of fracturing and physical and mechanical properties of rocks, etc.

  paragraph18: `Study of the formation conditions and the development mechanism of failures, inrush and losing funnel as well as water inflows (flooding) caused by technogenic impact during underground mining. - Study of the conditions for the formation of groundwater in connection with the deepening of development and their impact on the stability of mine workings under conditions of technogenic impact.
     Research ultimately allows timely, efficient and safe development (development) of deposits by open or underground mining methods.
     The main research areas of the laboratory are the application and development of modern methods for implementation in hydrogeological and engineering-geological studies.
