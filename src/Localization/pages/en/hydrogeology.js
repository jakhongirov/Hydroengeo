The study of the operating conditions of the system involves the study, construction and operation of mines and quarries in difficult geological and tectonic conditions and ensuring the safety of mining operations. 
  The trend of recent years in the development of the mining industry is involvement in the exploration and development of deposits characterized by more complex engineering and geological conditions and located at deep horizons. In this regard, the technogenic load on the geological environment increases, which leads to the development of unforeseen negative engineering and geological processes that complicate the development of deposits.

  paragraph18: `Peculiarities of engineering-geological conditions of deposits in mountain-folded areas in the Central Kyzylkum have been revealed. 
  The main feature of the deposits is that ore bodies cross several lithological rock varieties at a large angle and are confined to zones of tectonic faults. They are characterized by frequent alternation of various lithological varieties, unsustainable in thickness and strike, wide development of zones of schistosity and crushing of rocks, the presence of different types of differently oriented faults. 
  Lithological (for coal and phosphorite deposits) and lithological-tectonic (for all other types of deposits) principle of engineering-geological testing of rocks during exploration of deposits has been developed. The places, interval, number of sampling points depending on the stage of exploration are substantiated.
  A principle has been developed for compiling forecast maps of engineering-geological stability to changes in the natural environment during field development, based on a multi-parameter geomechanical classification of a rock mass.
  The main components of the rock mass (RM) are singled out depending on the specific gravity of each component, the appropriate “points” are established by the selection method. According to the numerical values of the total geomechanical parameters of the RM, the following categories of stability are distinguished: stable, medium stable, unstable.
