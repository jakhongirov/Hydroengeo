  paragraph5:
    "Until 1989, the A-373 Tashkent-Osh highway ran along the left side of the river. Akhangaran is below the Naugarzan quarry. In 1995 a landslide formed over the quarry, which led to the destruction of the road. It was moved to the right side of the valley and restored in place of the technological road on the working side of the Angrensky mine. After 9 years the state of the transport problem has not changed, and the presence of a road within the mining allotment on the working board hinders the development of the quarry. ",
